# E-paper-display-travel-times
This is some code for an E paper screen. It can tell you how long it will take for you to get to your destintation.
This code works with the waveshare 7.5inch e ink screen but I think that you should be able to use any waveshare screen (as long as you adjust the code).
You will also need your own Google Distance Matrix API KEY. The key should be free unless you use the key too much.
Make sure all the files are in the same directory (I used a rapberry pi).
